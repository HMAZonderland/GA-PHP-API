This project is a proof of concept for a school research paper.

This research paper is a assignment for the [Hogeschool Utrecht] (http://www.hu.nl) during the course Information Engineering.
The Assignment is commissioned by [esser-emmerik] (http://presenteren.nu). 
With this project the user can extract info from his [Google Analytics] (https://www.google.com/analytics/) account for a Magento webshop, then that extracted data is parsed and used for a calculation to calcutate the net revenue gained from a marketing campaign.

This project is written in PHP and uses the [Google Client library] (https://code.google.com/p/google-api-php-client/) for PHP.

A working version is runnning here: [Demo application] (http://esser-emmerik.hugozonderland.nl/GA/index.php) requires a google account that has access to Google Analytics
